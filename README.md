This is used as a platform for reviewers to check my code, i will upload a more reader frendly version of my code soon. 
The current version is the one used to produce pictures and the analysis in the masterthesis it does however include alot of unsued code blocks of ideas that werent followed through
Adittionally the annotation isnt great so that it might be hard to follow. Both are R markdown documents that can be opend in R studio.
For my analysis i first ran the Master_2.0 file and then the Master-removed outliers which provides the analysis without outliers.# Masterthesis_Bioinformatics
